# Color of Your Name
## Game Programming I:SY24 - Project 01

## Project Summary:
Students will learn the basics of JavaScript in order to create a tool that will generate a color based on the ASCII keycodes for 3 words typed into their program. They will learn how to use variables, functions and conditionals, as well as the basics of the p5js visual coding library to create their program. We will also explore how the data from controllers and keyboards are processed by the computer. Students will have the freedom to choose how the algorithm they write will handle the math involved to generate a unique R,G,B color value for your name.

## Essential Question: 
What does using JavaScript and p5.js to transform ASCII keycodes into vibrant colors reveal about the interplay between programming, data, and creative expression found in video games?

## Learning Targets:
### LT1: Programming Fundamentals
Students will demonstrate an understanding of fundamental programming concepts by effectively utilizing variables, functions, and conditionals to create a JavaScript program that generates colors based on ASCII keycodes.
### LT2: p5.js Proficiency
Students will develop proficiency in using the p5.js library, including the setup, keyPressed, and draw functions, to design and implement a dynamic and interactive color generation tool.
### LT3: Version Control with GitHub 
Students will acquire the skills necessary to manage their code using version control by creating, committing, and branching repositories on GitHub, ensuring a structured and protected development process.
### LT4: Input, Data Processing and RGB Color output 
Students will investigate how data flows from controllers to computers, and how electrical signals are translated into binary code. From binary code, students will understand how binary is translated into decimal and/or hexadecimal so that it can be used to create digital colors.
